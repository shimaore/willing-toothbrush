CouchDB-backed DNS for CCNQ4

Note: (FIXME) contrarily to most other apps, this one does not use the `nimble-direction` framework and does not include automated replication to a local CouchDB database. But since `nimble-direction` since version 2.2.0 supports local-only, this should be migrated to nimble-direction.
